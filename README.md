NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE! (This project uses dummy signatures and an unoptimized/underconstrained sorting algorithm)

# noir_top_three_demo

A simple demo where the top three pariticpants are returned.
- Dummy signatures (`sha256` hashes) are used for simplicity
- Sorting from scratch to demo `unconstrained` functions
- A few tests for the sorting functions are provided
